# US003 - Register a collaborator


## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As an HRM, I want to register a collaborator with a job and fundamental characteristics.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

**From the specifications document:**

>	Each collaborator has a main job (exclusively one).

>   Each collaborator is characterized by a set of characteristics.

**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question:** What are the fundamental characteristics of a collaborator?
>
> **Answer:** The minimal required data to characterize a collaborator is their name, birthdate, admission date, address, contact (email or phone number), identification document and number. Other relevant data can also be considered.

> **Question:** When creating a collaborator with an existing name ... What does the system do?
> 
> **Answer:** It's not common and most improbable to have different individual with same name in the same context, however itâ€™s ID documentation number should be unique for sure.

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

* **AC1:** All required fields must be filled in.
* **AC2:** When registering a collaborator with an existing ID documentation number, the system must reject such operation.

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies
