| Step 1  		     | 	... interacting with the actor?              | RegisterMaintenanceUI         | Pure Fabrication: there is no reason to assign this responsibility to any existing class in the Domain Model. |
| 			  		        | 	... coordinating the US?                     | RegisterMaintenanceController | Controller                                                                                                    |

| Step 6  		     | 	... validating all data (local validation)?  | Maintenance                   | IE: owns its data.                                                                                            |

| Step 8  		     | 	... informing operation success?             | RegisterMaintenanceUI         | IE: is responsible for user interactions.                                                                     | 


### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:

* Vehicle
* Maintenance

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified:

* RegisterMaintenanceUI
* RegisterMaintenanceController
* VehicleRepository


## 3.2. Sequence Diagram (SD)


### Full Diagram

This diagram shows the full sequence of interactions between the classes involved in the realization of this user story.

### Split Diagrams

The following diagram shows the same sequence of interactions between the classes involved in the realization of this user story, but it is split in partial diagrams to better illustrate the interactions between the classes.

It uses Interaction Occurrence (a.k.a. Interaction Use).
