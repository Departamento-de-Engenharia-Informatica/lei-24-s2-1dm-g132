### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

**From the specifications document:**

**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question:** Good afternoon, I would like to know between what ranges of hectares a green space is classified as garden, medium or large, or if it is possible to register 2 green spaces with the same area but in different typology, depending on the GSM it registers.
Thanks.

> **Answer:** The classification is not automatic, it's up to GSM decide about it.
Best regards.

> **Question:** Good afternoon,
Should the Green Space have any field in which it would store the GSM who created it, meaning that green space is managed by that GSM?
Best regards
> 
> **Answer:** Hi,
I have no knowledge about data models.
Best regards.

> **Question:** Can two green spaces have the same name?
>
> **Answer:** No
 
> **Question:** Should the green space have any more traits, other than the type of green space and area?
In which unit should the area be measured in?
Can the GSM register multiple green spaces at once?
> 
> **Answer:** Already answered in the forum and client session.
Usually, areas are measured in hectares.
That's a matter of UX/UI, each dev team can decide about it.
